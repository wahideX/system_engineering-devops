 This project provides an introduction to Linux processes and signals, covering the basics of managing process lifecycles, monitoring running processes, and using signals to control process behavior. Through hands-on tasks, learners will practice identifying process IDs, using commands to manipulate processes, and handling signals to start, stop, and modify processes. By the end of this project, learners will have a strong foundation in process management and be able to control processes within the Linux command line.
