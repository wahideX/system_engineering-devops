#!/usr/bin/env bash
# a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes with the following specific requirements:

    #Show all processes: This means including processes started by all users, not just your own.
    #Include processes without a TTY: A TTY (teletypewriter) is essentially a terminal. Many background services and system processes run without being attached to a terminal. Your output must include these.
    #Display in a user-oriented format: The output should be human-readable and provide relevant information like user, PID, CPU/memory usage, and the command itself.
    #Show process hierarchy: The output should visually represent which processes are children of other processes (e.g., using indentation).
ps -aux
