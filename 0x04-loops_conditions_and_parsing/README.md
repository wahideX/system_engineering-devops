his project introduces learners to loops, conditional statements, and basic input parsing in Bash scripting. Learners will develop skills in using control flow to automate repetitive tasks and handle decision-making in scripts. Through hands-on tasks, students will practice with for, while, and until loops, create conditional logic with if, elif, else, and use parsing techniques for handling input data. By the end of the project, learners will be able to build more dynamic and responsive shell scripts.
